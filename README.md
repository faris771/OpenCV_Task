# OpenCv_Task
## About this project
Task2 in my software engineering internship at [Imagry](https://github.com/imagry), the Idea of this task is to get hands on Image processing using OpenCV in C++ Language.
In this task, we are required to build a Live Web cam filter.

## Project Description
the final output should be in this form:


| First Column  | Second Column |
